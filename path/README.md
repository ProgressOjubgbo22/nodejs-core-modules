# Learning Node.js - Path Module

This folder contains my practice examples of Node.js Path module.

## What I am learning
- Joining paths using path.join()
- Resolving absolute paths using path.resolve()
- Getting filenames with path.basename()
- Getting directory names with path.dirname()
- Working with file extensions using path.extname()
- Parsing paths with path.parse()
- Formatting path objects with path.format()
- Normalizing paths using path.normalize()
- Accessing current file and folder using __filename and __dirname

## Purpose
I am practicing the Path module to understand how to work with file and directory paths in Node.js.

## Status
- ✅ Practiced all common path module methods
- ✅ Examples ready
