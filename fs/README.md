This folder contains my practice examples of Node.js File System (fs) module.

## What I am learning
- Reading files
- Writing files
- Appending data to files
- Deleting files
- Creating and deleting folders
- Checking if a file exists
- Renaming files

## Purpose
I am keeping track of my learning process by writing and testing real Node.js examples.  
This helps me understand how the fs module works before moving on to other Node.js modules.

## Status
