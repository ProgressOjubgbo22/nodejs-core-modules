# Learning Node.js - Core Modules

This repository documents my journey learning **Node.js core modules**.  
I am practicing the fundamentals to understand how Node.js works before using frameworks like Express.

## Modules Covered
- **File System (fs)** – reading, writing, appending, deleting files; creating and removing folders; checking existence; renaming files.
- **HTTP (http)** – creating servers, handling requests, sending responses.
- **URL (url)** – parsing URLs, accessing protocol, host, pathname, and query parameters.
- **Path (path)** – joining, resolving, parsing, formatting, and normalizing paths.
- **OS (os)** – accessing platform, architecture, memory, CPU info, home directory, uptime, and user info.

## Purpose
- Track my learning progress
- Practice real Node.js examples
- Understand core modules before moving to larger projects

## Status
- ✅ All 5 core modules practiced
- ✅ Each module has example code and README
- ✅ Ready for further projects and learning
