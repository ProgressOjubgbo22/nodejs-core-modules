# Learning Node.js - HTTP Module

This folder contains my practice examples of Node.js HTTP module.

## What I am learning
- Creating a basic HTTP server
- Handling URLs (routing)
- Working with request methods (GET, POST)
- Accessing request headers
- Sending responses using res.writeHead, res.write, res.end

## Purpose
I am keeping track of my learning process by writing and testing real Node.js HTTP examples.  
This helps me understand how Node.js servers work before moving on to routing and frameworks.

## Status
- ✅ Practiced basic HTTP server creation
- ✅ URL handling examples ready
- ✅ Request method & headers examples included
